I needed to make a web site that hosted a product catalog that let users download a zip file
of all images in a line, but also see individual images.  This script permits me to simply
place the .zip files on the host, and then I can link directly to the images inside the zip file,
rather than storing the large images twice on my small vps.

This is a *very* quick + dirty script.  No effort is made to efficently send
data from the decompressed archive to the client.  This is not intended to be
used on high-load sites. 

requires
--------

 * Plack (Builder, MIME)
 * Archive::Zip
 * perl 5.8.8+


nginx config
------------

Add this to your "server" section.  Note on debian + ubuntu /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params is installed
by the package manager, and includes some environment variables needed for FastCGI.

	location ~ \.zip/.*$ {
		fastcgi_pass unix:/home/mystik/zipview/fcgi.sock;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /home/mystik/zipview/testroot$fastcgi_script_name;
		fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_script_name;
		include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
	}
